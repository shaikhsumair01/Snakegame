The Snake game from the early 20s created by me. 
Steps to run the game:
In order to run the project, download all the python files. 
The main.py file has the entire logic of the game. You will have to run main.py to play the game.
The snake.py file has the snake class where the snake is created using turtle graphics. It also contains the entire functionality of the snake such as movement and growth etc.
The food.py contains the food class which is another object created using turtle graphics. It contains how the food, which is a turtle object, is initialized and then using random module, it is placed on the screen.
Lastly we have scoreboard.py which has the score class again created using turtle graphics. It is used to update the score each time the snake eats the food.

Since the main.py is having turtle module, when you run it the screen window will pop up. The game works with keyboard presses namely up, down left and right.
